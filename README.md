Todo Service
Design and implement a backend service allowing basic management of a simple to-do list.
Functional requirements
Each to-do item has the following attributes:
description,
status: "not done", "done", "past due",
date-time of creation,
due date-time,
date-time at which the item was marked as done.
The service should provide a RESTful API that allows to:
add an item,
change description of an item,
mark an item as "done",
mark an item as "not done",
get all items that are "not done" (with an option to retrieve all items),
get details of a specific item.
The service should automatically change status of items that are past their due date as "past due".
The service should forbid changing "past due" items via its REST API.
Non-functional requirements
the service should:
be dockerized
use H2 in-memory database
contain automatic tests (we don't expect a very high coverage but would like to see your approach to writing automatic tests)
the service should not:
implement authentication
readme should contain brief notes covering:
service description and made assumptions
tech stack used (runtime environment, frameworks, key libraries)
how to:
build the service
run automatic tests
run the service locally
Evaluation criteria
alignment with the requirements
usage of best practices when dealing with edge cases that are not covered here
code quality and readability
presence and quality of (or lack of) automatic tests
commit history (thought process, commit messages)
Your work should be handed off in a form of a link to a git repository we can clone into.
